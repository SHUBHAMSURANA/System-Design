Let me explain the fund of stretegic design pattern

TAKE EXPMAPLE OF GOOLE MAP WE need to got from A to B.
iF we choose car , we will get different route
iF we choose bike , we will get different route

So we need differnt strategy to achive the goal.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Payment Gateway Integrations (Payment Processing)
üí° Problem:
An e-commerce platform needs to support different payment methods: PayPal, Stripe, Razorpay, Google Pay, etc.

üîß Strategy Pattern Applied:
Each payment method is a different strategy, implementing a PaymentStrategy interface.

java
Copy
Edit
interface PaymentStrategy {
    void pay(Order order);
}

class PayPalPaymentStrategy implements PaymentStrategy { ... }
class StripePaymentStrategy implements PaymentStrategy { ... }
class RazorpayPaymentStrategy implements PaymentStrategy { ... }
‚û°Ô∏è At runtime, the right payment strategy is selected based on user choice.
